    <h2>Editing Tribes</h2>
        <p>Tribe names are mapped from what Sage outputs to a different name in the Tribal supporting document. These mappings can be changed by editing TribeList.xlsx in the SageToPDF\Templates\ folder (typically found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Sage To PDF).</p>
        <p>Only two columns are used by the program. Values in all other columns are ignored.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Sage Tribal List</h4>
                <p>The name that Sage will export to Excel. This should exactly match everything before the "Item:" in the "Trans Descriptions" column.</p>
                <p>Sage truncates anything beyond 30 characters, this program mimics that by ignoring anything in this column beyond 30 characters.</p>
                <p>E.G.: "Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior" is shortened to "Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake S" while searching.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Tribal</h4>
                <p>The name that will be saved in the Tribal supporting document. There are no restrictions on this beyond that it should fit on a single line.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>END</h4>
                <p>This signifies the end of the list of tribes to load.</p>
                <p>WARNING: Without this the program will keep reading the spreadsheet until it crashes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Editing Templates</h2>
        <p>Any of the templates used for creating Tribal, Mapping, Ethno, and Field Survey reports can be edited to change the formatting. These files are located in the SageToPDF program folder under Templates\.</p>
        <h4>Restrictions:</h4>
        <p>These files must keep their original names or SageToPDF will not be able to see them. Any words with surrounded with underscores (e.g. "_state_") should not be changed or removed. These are identifiers SageToPDF will use to place key information correctly.</p>

    <h2>Preferences</h2>
        <p>You can change your default save and open locations in the Preferences menu. These changes will be saved to a .prop file in your SageToPDF program folder.</p>
        <p>Note: The save location will be used as a default file name if it does not end in a "\". For example: "C:\SomeFolder\SaveFolder" will use saveFolder as the output name unless you change it yourself. "C:\SomeFolder\SaveFolder\" signifies a folder.</p>
